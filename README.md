## About guess image game bot

This bot allows you to play game ðŸ¤–.
The purpose of the game is to guess what is displayed on the picture picture.
The difficulty is that the picture is shown either partially or blurred or shuffled, so that guessing is more interesting.
If the player guesses correctly, he wins and earns a plus to his player rating.
It is possible to ask for a hint :)

You can play alone but it's more fun to play with friends in group. Just need to make it admin.
